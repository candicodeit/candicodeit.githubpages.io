Hi! I'm Candi! By day, I work at Boats Group as a front end developer with my main focus on A/B Testing and user research for our portals. By night, I support the readers of A Book Apart, a small publishing company focused on creating books on the latest web topics.

My passion for the web started when I was browsing the internet through AOL as a high school senior. I dabbled with the AOL Instant Messenger code and progressed into creating my own website on Angelfire. In college, I quickly changed my major from Business Management to Computer Information Systems. Classes on SQL and debugging seemed to come natural to me. I worked for private companies and advertising agencies on websites for restaurants, hotels, apartment communities, property management software, tourism and a jewelry store. The most memorable project was working on [Made By Hand](http://thisismadebyhand.com/), my first responsive design project with the talented [Mandy Brown](http://aworkinglibrary.com/).

Mixed in with my web career, I've had interesting positions outside of coding. I was the podcast producer for [5by5](http://5by5.tv/).
